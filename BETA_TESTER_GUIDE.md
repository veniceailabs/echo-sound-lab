## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is my audio quiet after mastering?**
A: Check the LUFS target - we aim for -14 LUFS (streaming standard). Use the limiter for more loudness.

**Q: Can I save projects?**
A: Yes! Sessions auto-save. Your last project loads when you return.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: Partially. Basic processing works offline, but AI features need internet.

**Q: What's the difference between AI Studio and regular mode?**
A: Regular mode is for mastering existing tracks. AI Studio generates new music from scratch.

**Q: Can I upload copyrighted music?**
A: For testing purposes, yes. Don't distribute the results without proper rights.
