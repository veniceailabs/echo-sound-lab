SECTION 5: ROUTING CONTRACT (MERGED & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

5) Routing Contract

ADAM routes finished work to legitimate surfaces.

This section locks what routing is, when it ends, and what ADAM will never become.

================================================================================

5.1) Definition of Finished Work

Finished work is:
- Mixed and mastered audio (ESL-approved)
- Release-ready (artist confirms intent to release)
- Immutable in content (the audio itself does not change)
- Metadata-stable (title, artist name, duration are fixed)
- Versioned clearly (if a new version exists, it is a new work, not an update)

Finished work is NOT:
- Drafts or work-in-progress
- Unmastered or pre-release versions
- Work where artist intent is uncertain
- Content that will be re-edited after routing begins
- Placeholder or test versions

Once routing begins, the work itself does not change.

================================================================================

5.2) Definition of a Routing Action

A routing action is a single, discrete submission to one legitimate surface:

- Submission to a playlist curator (one curator, one playlist, one time)
- Publication to a direct-to-fan surface (Bandcamp, artist's own link, etc.)
- Listing in an opt-in community (one community, one submission)
- Entry into a verified radio show or newsletter submission path
- Link to a tipping/support surface (Patreon, Ko-fi, etc.)

One surface = one routing action.
One submission = one completed action.

A routing action is complete when:
- The submission has been sent to the surface
- The surface has acknowledged receipt (or rejected it)
- The work is now in the surface's control
- ADAM's role in that specific action ends

================================================================================

5.3) Completion Boundary (Where Routing Ends)

Routing is complete at first confirmed delivery to a legitimate surface.

After delivery:
- The surface owns what happens next
- ADAM does not track outcomes
- ADAM does not re-evaluate responses
- ADAM does not re-submit or follow up
- ADAM does not adapt the work, title, or packaging based on response
- ADAM does not expand targeting based on what didn't land

After delivery, it's the world's turn.
ADAM steps back.

Once a routing action is complete:
- Artist is notified (what was sent, where, when, status)
- ADAM provides the submission details
- ADAM does not monitor, chase, or re-engage that surface
- If the surface responds later (acceptance, rejection, requests), artist handles it directly
- ADAM does not re-route the same work to the same surface unless artist explicitly requests it

This is not neglect. This is respect for boundaries.

================================================================================

5.4) What Routing Explicitly Is Not

ADAM will never:

**Pursue outcomes**
- Re-submit because of low response
- "Follow up" with surfaces
- Escalate if curators don't accept
- Retry after rejection
- Contact surfaces multiple times about the same work

**Adapt or optimize content post-delivery**
- Change song title, artist name, or metadata after submission
- Re-edit audio based on performance
- Create alternate versions to "increase chances"
- Modify descriptions or packaging based on response
- A/B test different presentations

**Expand targets reactively**
- Add new surfaces because others "didn't work"
- Broaden search criteria based on initial response
- Automatically increase routing scope if early results are low
- Target "adjacent" audiences without explicit artist consent

**Interpret or respond to silence**
- Assume non-response is acceptance
- Use lack of feedback as permission to escalate
- Treat rejection as a reason to re-route
- Turn no news into action

**Apply performance-based logic**
- Re-route based on play count, support, or engagement metrics
- "Optimize" routing based on what's "working"
- Change strategy mid-release based on early responses
- Use outcomes to justify additional actions

**Pursue the work past first delivery**
- Monitor how the work performs after delivery
- Adjust future routing based on first-action performance
- Treat first delivery as "beta" for better targeting later
- Use initial results to inform broader campaigns

================================================================================

5.5) Immutability & Versioning

**Metadata Immutability**

After a routing action begins, the work's metadata cannot change without new consent:

Artist cannot decide to:
- Change the song title mid-routing
- Change artist name/branding mid-routing
- Re-edit audio after submission begins
- Repackage covers or descriptions in ways that constitute a new work

If the artist wants to change these things, routing stops and new consent is required.

This prevents "light tweaks" from becoming continuous optimization.

**Versioning (New Work = New Routing)**

If an artist creates a new version of the work (remix, remaster, re-edit):
- It is a separate work
- It requires separate finished-work confirmation
- It requires new routing consent
- It is routed independently

Versions are not "updates to ongoing routing."
They are new works.

================================================================================

5.6) No Outcome Tracking / No Persistence

**No Performance Metrics**

ADAM does not:
- Track how many listens the work gets
- Monitor support/tipping numbers
- Flag "underperforming" submissions
- Use performance to recommend re-routing
- Create urgency based on "low response"

ADAM routes and steps back.
What happens after is the work's own story.

**No Assumed Expansion**

Silence means no.
Inaction means no.
Only explicit artist consent triggers new routing.

Any new routing requires new consent.
"But I thought ADAM would…" does not count.
Only explicit "yes" to new targets.

================================================================================

5.7) Why These Boundaries Exist (Design Intent)

These boundaries prevent a known decay pattern:

Systems begin by routing work honestly. But without hard boundaries, they drift:

1. Low response to initial routing → system sees "opportunity"
2. System suggests expansion (sounds helpful)
3. Artist doesn't actively refuse → system assumes approval
4. System adds targets, optimizes presentation, monitors performance
5. System becomes an invisible marketing engine
6. Artist discovers the system has been "optimizing" without consent
7. "We were just helping you reach more people" becomes the justification

This rot is not malice. It's scope creep.

It is prevented by:
- One-time-per-surface submissions (no retries, no escalation)
- No outcome tracking (removes the data that justifies expansion)
- Clear completion (routing ends at delivery, not at success)
- Artist-initiated expansion only (no assumed consent from silence)
- Immutability (prevents "light tweaks" from becoming deep manipulation)

To stay aligned with Section 1's promise (artist survival, not optimization), these
boundaries must be architectural, not policy choices.

================================================================================

5.8) Binding Statement

Routing is complete at first confirmed delivery to a legitimate surface. ADAM does not
pursue outcomes, re-engage surfaces, adapt content, or expand scope unless the artist
explicitly initiates a new routing action. Silence is not consent. Performance is not
permission. Routing ends so the work can live in the world without ADAM's interference.
