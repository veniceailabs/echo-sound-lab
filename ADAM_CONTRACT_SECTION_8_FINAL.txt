SECTION 8: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (FINAL & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

8) Acceptance Criteria

ADAM is considered "working" if and only if all criteria below hold true simultaneously.

Failure of any single criterion constitutes a contract breach, not a feature gap or roadmap item.

================================================================================

8.1) Authority Integrity Test (AC-1)

ADAM never performs an action outside A0–A2.

✅ Pass condition:
- No action executes without explicit A2 consent (logged, scoped, time-bounded)
- No background or ambient actions occur
- A3 behavior is structurally impossible (verified in code)
- If consent is absent, expired, or revoked → no action executes

❌ Fail condition:
- Any action executes without a fresh, scoped A2 consent
- Any background automation occurs
- Any ambient permission mode exists

================================================================================

8.2) Consent Enforcement Test (AC-2)

Silence, inactivity, or past approval never result in action.

✅ Pass condition:
- Silence always resolves to "no" (verified by audit log)
- Past consent does not carry forward to new actions
- Consent is scoped, time-bounded, and expires by default
- New routing always requires new explicit consent

❌ Fail condition:
- Any action occurs due to assumed consent
- Any action occurs due to inherited consent from previous actions
- Any action occurs due to ambient settings carrying forward
- Any action occurs because artist "didn't say no"

================================================================================

8.3) Routing Boundary Test (AC-3)

Routing ends at first confirmed delivery. No persistence, no escalation.

✅ Pass condition:
- One surface = one discrete routing action
- No retries, follow-ups, or escalations occur without new artist initiation
- No adaptive behavior based on outcomes (acceptance/rejection/silence)
- No performance-based re-routing, expansion, or scope increase
- ADAM steps back completely after delivery confirmed

❌ Fail condition:
- ADAM re-engages a surface without explicit artist request
- ADAM expands target list based on initial response
- ADAM retries due to rejection or silence
- ADAM adapts routing strategy based on performance
- ADAM monitors or tracks how routing performs after delivery

================================================================================

8.4) Immutability & Versioning Test (AC-4)

Finished work never changes mid-routing.

✅ Pass condition:
- Audio content is immutable post-consent (verified by hash or checksum)
- Metadata (title, artist name, duration) is immutable post-consent
- Any modification by artist triggers routing termination + new consent requirement
- New versions (remixes, remasters) are treated as new works, routed independently

❌ Fail condition:
- Any "light tweak" or metadata change occurs without resetting routing
- Artist can edit song title/artist mid-submission
- "Versions" are treated as updates to ongoing routing instead of new works
- Descriptions or packaging change after submission without artist re-consent

================================================================================

8.5) Money Flow Guarantee Test (AC-5)

Money reaches the artist directly, transparently, and on time.

✅ Pass condition:
- All fees are itemized before artist approves payment method (logged)
- Settlement occurs same-day or next business day (verified by payout logs)
- ADAM never touches funds without explicit, scoped artist authorization
- Artist can exit any payment method instantly without penalty or restriction
- Artist owns all listener data and payment relationship
- Money flows directly to artist's chosen account (not through ADAM unless authorized)

❌ Fail condition:
- Any hidden, deferred, or surprise fees
- Settlement delayed beyond stated timeline
- ADAM holds funds without explicit authorization
- Artist forced into exclusive payment processing
- Artist cannot exit payment paths without penalty
- Listener data bundled or monetized
- Money flows through ADAM by default

================================================================================

8.6) Reporting Neutrality Test (AC-6)

ADAM reports facts, never implications.

✅ Pass condition:
- Only completed actions and money movement are reported
- Reports contain no comparisons, rates, rankings, percentiles, or trends
- Reports contain no predictions, projections, or performance analysis
- Reports contain no coaching, suggestions, or evaluative language
- Silence is the default state (artist must opt-in to notifications)
- Language is purely factual ("X occurred" not "Only X" or "Low X")

❌ Fail condition:
- Any report implies judgment or comparison
- Any report includes rates, ratios, or "typical" language
- Any report includes predictions or "based on results, you should"
- Any report uses positive or negative framing ("Great!" or "Underperforming")
- Any report includes coaching or next-step suggestions
- Default state is noisy (artist must opt-out of notifications)

================================================================================

8.7) Undo Symmetry Test (AC-7)

Undo is as easy as action, always.

✅ Pass condition:
- Revoke is one click for one-click actions (measured by UI/API steps)
- Revocation is honored before, during, and after execution
- Revocation never triggers confirmations, warnings, or regret framing
- Revocation executes immediately (no cooldowns, delays, or processing)
- Undo leaves no behavioral residue (verified by audit log showing no future influence)
- System state returns to A0/A1, clean slate

❌ Fail condition:
- Undo is harder or slower than action
- "Are you sure?" or similar confirmation occurs
- Regret framing ("You're giving up," "Missed opportunity")
- Revocation is delayed or queued
- System remembers undo in behavioral logs or uses it for future decisions
- Revocation affects recommendations, suggestions, or future consent prompts

================================================================================

8.8) Drift Detection Test (AC-8)

If ADAM starts behaving like marketing, it is broken.

✅ Pass condition:
- ADAM never optimizes for performance metrics
- ADAM never reacts to outcomes (accepts/rejects/silence)
- ADAM never escalates scope automatically
- ADAM never nudges artist behavior based on data
- ADAM never retains psychological leverage over artist
- ADAM cannot be mistaken for a campaign manager, growth engine, or optimizer

❌ Fail condition:
- ADAM uses performance data to justify expansion
- ADAM treats low response as reason for action
- ADAM suggests "better" strategies based on results
- ADAM creates urgency or FOMO
- ADAM develops sophisticated heuristics for "optimal" routing
- Any feature can be framed as "just helping the artist optimize"

================================================================================

8.9) Meta-Rule (Self-Policing)

If engineers can argue "technically this still counts as routing," ADAM has already failed.

The spirit of the contract is the test, not the letter.

Any feature that:
    •    sounds reasonable in isolation
    •    but violates the intent of Sections 1–7
    •    is a breach

Code review must ask: "Could this be mistaken for marketing?"

If yes, it does not ship.

================================================================================

8.10) Binding Statement

ADAM is working if all eight acceptance criteria pass simultaneously. Failure of any one criterion is a contract breach requiring immediate remediation. These tests are not optional, aspirational, or negotiable. They are the definition of "working ADAM."
