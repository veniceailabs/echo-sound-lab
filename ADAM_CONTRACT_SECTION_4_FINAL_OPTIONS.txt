SECTION 4: MONEY FLOW GUARANTEE — Three Options (Reframed)

================================================================================

OPTION A (Transparency-First / Anti-Skimming)

Failure mode prevented: Hidden fees, invisible intermediaries, "small cut" creep

Key question: If a dollar moves, can the artist trace it end-to-end?

================================================================================

## 4) Money Flow Guarantee

Money is never secret in ADAM.

Every transaction is traced from payer to artist with zero ambiguity about fees, holds, or
intermediaries.

### Who Pays, Who Gets Paid

Clarity on every transaction:
- Payer: The listener (identified by payment method)
- Payee: The artist (identified by artist account)
- Intermediaries: All named, all fees stated

If there are more than three parties, the transaction is not offered.

### The Transparency Promise (Binding)

Before any money moves, the artist sees:

Listener pays: $10.00
  - Payment processor fee: $0.30
  - Platform fee (if applicable): $1.00
  - ADAM fee: $0.00 (always)
Artist receives: $8.70
Settlement: Tomorrow by 2pm

This is shown to the artist before the artist approves the payment method.
This is shown to the listener before the listener confirms payment.

No variations. No "approximately." No "up to."

### When ADAM Touches Funds (Rare)

ADAM only touches funds if:
- Artist explicitly authorizes it (in writing, per action type)
- Purpose is stated (e.g., "hold for batch payout" or "currency conversion")
- Timeline is locked ("held until X date")
- Artist can revoke the authorization anytime

ADAM never:
- Holds money without explicit authorization
- Takes a percentage
- Mixes artist funds with operational funds
- Uses artist money for float or operations

If ADAM cannot offer a money path without touching funds, ADAM discloses this and the artist
decides.

### No Ambiguous Language

This section forbids:
- "Up to X%"
- "Approximately"
- "May include"
- "Typical range"
- "Subject to change"
- "Processing costs not included"

Every fee is exact.
Every timeline is certain.
Every exception is named.

### Fee Itemization (Unchanging in MVP)

All fees are locked for MVP:
- Payment processor fee: Stated per method
- Platform fee (if any): Stated upfront
- ADAM fee: Never charged

If fees change, artist is notified and can disable that payment method.
Fee changes do not apply retroactively.

### Platform Changes & Artist Protection

If a payment platform (Stripe, Bandcamp, etc.) changes its fees or terms:
- Artist is notified immediately
- Artist can disable that method
- Artist's money is unaffected
- ADAM does not absorb the platform's changes and hide them

Artist owns the decision to accept or reject new terms.

### Audit Trail (Artist Always Visible)

Artist can see at any time:
- Every transaction (gross + net)
- Every fee broken down
- Every hold or delay (reason stated)
- Timing of settlement
- Proof of payment to artist account

If artist questions any line item, ADAM must explain it or refund it.
Artist wins audit disputes by default.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it's more efficient, ADAM will not:
- Use vague fee language
- Hide intermediaries
- Charge percentage-based cuts
- Hold money without explicit authorization
- Change fees without artist opt-in
- Obfuscate settlement timelines
- Treat artist money as operational float

Transparency is architectural, not optional.

### Binding Statement

Every dollar is traced end-to-end with zero hidden fees or intermediaries. All fees are
exact, shown before action, and changeable only with artist consent. ADAM never touches
artist funds without explicit per-transaction authorization. Artist always sees and approves
the full transaction path before money moves.

================================================================================

OPTION B (Speed-First / Anti-Starvation)

Failure mode prevented: Artists waiting months while platforms float cash

Key question: How fast can an artist turn attention into food?

================================================================================

## 4) Money Flow Guarantee

ADAM exists so artists can earn food today, not hope for royalties in three months.

Every payment path in ADAM is designed for speed: same-day or next-business-day settlement,
no artificial holds, no "safety" delays.

### The Settlement Promise

When a listener pays through ADAM routing:

1. Payment is received and confirmed
2. Artist is notified in real-time with amount and timing
3. Settlement happens on stated day (same-day, next-business-day)
4. Money is in artist's account by promised time or ADAM compensates

No "pending" states.
No "processing."
No mysterious delays.

### Routing vs. Settlement (Clear Distinction)

**Routing** = ADAM sends the work to a surface (Bandcamp, curator, support link)
- Can be instant or batched
- Artist approves before routing

**Settlement** = Listener pays and money moves to artist
- Same-day or next-business-day (locked)
- No delays between payer and artist account

Routing and settlement are separate. Artist knows both timelines upfront.

### Default Settlement Speed

All paths default to:
- Direct payments: Same-day or within 24 hours
- Bank transfers: Next business day
- Special routes: Stated timeline upfront, or not offered

If a route cannot meet these timelines, it is not available in ADAM MVP.

### Real-Time Accounting

Artist sees in real-time:
- Payment received: $10.00 (time-stamped)
- Processing: $0.30 fee deducted
- Artist receives: $9.70 (settlement time: tomorrow 2pm)
- What's pending, what's settled
- Running total (today, week, month)

No guessing about money in flight.

### Who Receives (Artist's Choice)

Artist chooses where money lands:
- Stripe account
- Bank transfer
- PayPal
- Artist's own payment processor
- Multiple destinations simultaneously

ADAM does not route money through an ADAM account unless explicitly approved per transaction type.

Money reaches artist's chosen account directly or ADAM compensates for the delay.

### No Holds (Except Explicit Ones)

ADAM does not:
- Hold money for "safety"
- Require minimum payouts before settlement
- Delay settlement to batch transactions
- Use float for operations
- Reserve money for chargebacks (unless artist agrees)

If a payment processor requests a hold, artist is notified immediately and can reject that
payment method.

### Chargeback & Dispute Handling

If a listener disputes a payment:
1. Artist is notified immediately
2. Dispute timeline is stated (when resolution expected)
3. Artist is not penalized for the dispute
4. If resolved in artist's favor, funds are returned immediately
5. If resolved against artist, artist is not charged fees for the dispute

Artist is not punished for listeners' disputes.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it costs more, ADAM will not:
- Delay settlement beyond next business day
- Create batching minimums that delay payout
- Charge artists for "faster" settlement (i.e., no premium tiers)
- Use natural payment processor delays as justification for further delays
- Hold money while "verifying" legitimacy
- Restrict withdrawal frequency

Speed is a guarantee, not a premium feature.

### Binding Statement

Settlement is same-day or next-business-day, guaranteed. No holds without explicit artist
consent. No fees for speed. Money moves predictably to artist's chosen account or ADAM
compensates for delay. Artists know exactly when they'll be paid before they approve routing.

================================================================================

OPTION C (Ownership-First / Anti-Extraction)

Failure mode prevented: Rights grabs, exclusivity pressure, data monetization via back door

Key question: Who owns the money, the work, and the relationship?

================================================================================

## 4) Money Flow Guarantee

Money flows are owned and controlled by the artist. ADAM routes; ADAM does not own.

No rights transfer. No data monetization. No exclusivity hidden in payment terms.
Artist retains 100% ownership of money, work, and listener relationship.

### Artist Owns the Money Path

The artist:
- Chooses which payment methods are available
- Owns the payment account (directly, not through ADAM)
- Controls who receives funds
- Can change methods anytime
- Can add new payment options anytime
- Can exit payment methods without penalty

ADAM executes the artist's choice. ADAM does not architect the choice.

### Money Never Flows Through ADAM

Default: Money flows directly from listener to artist's account.

If ADAM must be in the chain (e.g., currency conversion, batch processing), artist approves
per transaction type and can revoke anytime.

When ADAM is in the chain:
- Artist sees the path before money moves
- Artist can reject and choose alternative
- ADAM is transparent about hold time, fees, and purpose
- Money is returned to artist if artist revokes authorization

Money flows around ADAM, not through it, by default.

### No Rights Transfer

Paying through ADAM-routed surfaces does not:
- Transfer any rights to the artist's work
- Grant ADAM or platforms rights to redistribute the work
- Create exclusivity obligations
- Bind the artist to future terms they didn't agree to
- Imply the artist consents to alternate versions of their work

Artist's relationship with the listener stays with the artist.

### Data Ownership (Artist-Controlled)

Artist owns:
- Fan/listener data (emails, payment info, support history)
- Aggregated data (how many tips, trends, patterns)
- Right to use this data for their own marketing
- Right to export this data anytime

ADAM does not:
- Sell listener data
- Bundle artist identity with payment data for resale
- Use payment data for targeting or profiling (even first-party)
- Combine artist's payment patterns with other artists for analysis
- Retain data longer than necessary for settlement and audit

Artist data belongs to the artist. Always.

### Artist Controls Settlement Terms

Artist decides:
- Payout frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, or on-demand)
- Minimum threshold (or no minimum)
- Currency or account destination
- Whether to batch or stream payouts
- When to change any of the above

ADAM does not impose defaults that benefit ADAM.

### Audit Rights (Complete & Binding)

Artist can audit:
- Every transaction detail
- Every fee charged
- Every hold or delay
- ADAM's ledger showing what artist is owed
- Communication from payment processors about delays or issues

If ADAM cannot explain something, artist can demand a refund.
Audit disputes are resolved in artist's favor.

### Exit Rights (Zero Penalty)

Artist can:
- Remove ADAM routing anytime
- Move payment processing to a different system
- Redirect future money elsewhere
- Request a complete data export
- Receive no penalty, degradation, or restriction

Exit is as easy as entry. No switching costs. No retaliation.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it means lower adoption or slower scaling, ADAM will not:
- Require exclusive payment processing
- Extract data from payment transactions
- Claim rights to listener data
- Restrict artist's ability to use payments elsewhere
- Penalize artists who move money to competing systems
- Use payment information for anything beyond settlement

Artist owns the money. Artist owns the relationship. Artist decides the terms.

### Binding Statement

Artist owns all money, all data, all payment methods, and the listener relationship. Money
flows directly to artist accounts. No rights transfer implied. No data monetization allowed.
Artist has full audit rights and can exit payment processing anytime without penalty or
restriction. ADAM routes money; ADAM never owns it.
