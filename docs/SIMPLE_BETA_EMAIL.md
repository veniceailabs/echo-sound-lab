---

Hi there,

Echo Sound Lab v2.5 is now live and we'd love for you to test it out!

## Get Started in 3 Steps

**1. Open the app**
https://echosoundlab.vercel.app

**2. Upload an audio file**
MP3, WAV, M4A, or FLAC (up to 50MB)

**3. Get AI Recommendations & Apply Fixes**
- Click "Generate Report" (wait 5-15 seconds)
- Review recommendations in the Echo Report panel
- Click "Apply All" or select individual fixes you like
- Listen to your processed track vs original
- Export your mastered audio

Done!

## What We're Testing

We built v2.5 specifically to fix these things:

✅ **Better Audio Quality** - No more "crunching" after recommendations
✅ **Precise EQ Control** - Now 6 Channel bands + 4 Parametric bands (all audible!)
✅ **Smarter AI** - "Apply All" button to accept recommendations at once
✅ **Settings Save** - Your EQ adjustments persist after you save
✅ **Real-time Response** - Hear changes instantly as you adjust

## Help Us By Testing

Please try these and let us know if they work:

- Audio uploads smoothly
- AI recommendations make sense for YOUR music
- When you apply fixes, the audio actually improves
- The EQ changes are clearly audible
- No crashes or weird errors
