# Echo Sound Lab Beta Email (Ready To Send)

Hello,

Echo Sound Lab Beta is officially live, and we'd love your feedback.

https://echo-sound-lab.vercel.app

Time needed: **10-15 minutes**

Please test all tabs, with extra focus on **Mixing and Mastering** in:
- **Single Track**
- **Stems**

Please complete one full loop:
1. In **AI Studio**, record a short idea and build a song.
2. Confirm the cover art appears in your Library.
3. Open the track in **Single Track** and run **Improve My Mix**.
4. Create a short visual in the **SFS Video Engine**.

When finished, click the in-app **Feedback** button (bottom-right).

It opens a pre-filled email to:
**liveconsciouslyllc@gmail.com**

What we care about most:
- Bugs or crashes
- Audio quality issues
- Confusing UX moments
- The top 1-2 changes you'd want before launch

Thank you for helping shape this release.

- Echo Sound Lab Team

Warm regards,

Andra V. Kenner Jr.
