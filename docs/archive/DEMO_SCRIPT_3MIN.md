# ECHO SOUND LAB: 3-MINUTE EXTENDED DEMO SCRIPT
## "The Full Feature Walkthrough" — What AI-Assisted Mastering Looks Like

---

## 🎬 SHOT LIST & TIMING (3:00 total)

### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION & UPLOAD (0:00-0:30)

#### SHOT 1A: Cold Open (0:00-0:05)
**Action:**
- Fade in on Echo Sound Lab dashboard (dark interface, professional aesthetic)
- Logo/branding visible
- Empty state or previous project shown

**Visual Cue:** Clean, modern interface. Professional audio engineering vibe.

**Voiceover:**
"Meet Echo Sound Lab. Where AI understands music, and you control the output."

---

#### SHOT 1B: File Upload & Visualizer (0:05-0:30)
**Action:**
- Drag-and-drop a mixed track (use a rough vocal/mixed track)
- Waveform loads with smooth animation
- LUFS stats bar appears (Loudness, True Peak, LU Range)
- Sonic Analysis panel populates:
  - Genre badge (e.g., "Indie Pop")
  - Loudness (RMS)
  - Dynamic Range
  - Peak Level
  - Spectral Balance
- Show the visualizer with RAW/A-B toggle (highlight but don't toggle yet)

**Visual Cue:** Real-time metrics. Data-driven analysis, not guessing.

**Voiceover:**
"Upload your mix. Instant analysis. We measure loudness, dynamics, spectral balance, and genre characteristics in real-time. This is the foundation of intelligent mastering."

---

### SECTION 2: AI ANALYSIS & SUGGESTIONS (0:30-1:30)

#### SHOT 2A: AI Listening Pass (0:30-0:50)
**Action:**
- Show Listening Pass Card populating with analysis tokens
- Display confidence levels for detected characteristics
- Show brief AI insight toggle (turn it on to show sample insight text)
- Keep focus on the data-driven nature of the analysis

**Visual Cue:** Green checkmarks/confidence scores. Scientific, not magical.

**Voiceover:**
"The Listening Pass is our perceptual analysis layer. It doesn't just measure—it understands. It detects recording artifacts, vocal balance, instrumental separation, and energy distribution. Every analysis includes a confidence score. Nothing is guesswork."

---

#### SHOT 2B: AI Recommendations Panel (0:50-1:30)
**Action:**
- AI Recommendations panel is now visible with 6-8 suggestion categories
- Each category has an icon (EQ icon, Compressor icon, Reverb icon, Stereo icon, etc.)
- User slowly clicks through and selects 3-4 suggestions:
  1. "Add gentle EQ: Boost 4kHz" (click checkbox)
  2. "Apply compression: Attack 5ms, Ratio 4:1, Threshold -18dB" (click checkbox)
  3. "Subtle reverb: Room warmth" (click checkbox)
  4. One optional suggestion is shown but NOT selected
- As each is selected, show a subtle highlight/glow effect
- Display the specific parameter values in tooltips as they're checked

**Visual Cue:** The checkboxes represent **user agency**. AI suggests. Human approves.

**Voiceover:**
"Here's where the collaboration happens. The AI provides suggestions—specific, quantified recommendations with exact parameter values. But you decide. Check the ones you agree with. Skip the ones you don't. This is AI assisting, not AI deciding. You see the exact parameters before anything is applied."

---

### SECTION 3: APPLICATION & ANALYSIS (1:30-2:00)

#### SHOT 3A: Processing & Re-analysis (1:30-1:50)
**Action:**
- Click "Apply Fixes" button
- Show processing indicator (progress bar or spinner)
- Waveform in visualizer visibly changes (loudness increases, dynamic range compresses)
- LUFS stats update in real-time
- Processing completes with subtle success visual

**Visual Cue:** Transformation visible. Before/after comparison is obvious.

**Voiceover:**
"The engine applies your selections and reanalyzes. Notice the waveform changes—the loudness increases, the dynamics compress, the spectral balance shifts. Every change is audible and visible."

---

#### SHOT 3B: Echo Report Card Verdict (1:50-2:00)
**Action:**
- Echo Report Card appears with:
  - Verdict badge ("release_ready" or "refinements_available")
  - Summary statement
  - Recommended actions list (3-4 bullet points)
  - Score breakdown (total, recording quality, stem quality, etc.)
  - Confidence score (e.g., 0.94)
- Highlight the verdict clearly
- Show the shareable card preview option

**Visual Cue:** Professional report. Credible judgment.

**Voiceover:**
"The Echo Report Card gives you a professional mastering verdict. It tells you if your track is release-ready, what refinements are needed, and exactly what changed. This is the recommendation that matters."

---

### SECTION 4: FINE-TUNING & PLUGIN CONTROL (2:00-2:45)

#### SHOT 4A: Plugin Refinement (2:00-2:30)
**Action:**
- User clicks on one of the Echo Report suggestions (e.g., "Compressor: Threshold -18dB might be too aggressive for vocal clarity")
- Plugin UI opens (show a professional compressor interface or parametric EQ)
- Visualize the plugin with:
  - Sliders for key parameters
  - Frequency display (if EQ)
  - Frequency analyzer overlay showing the signal
  - Real-time level meters
- User adjusts **one** parameter (drag a slider slightly, e.g., threshold from -18 to -12)
- Click "Apply" or "Update Suggestion"
- Show the plugin close and report card update to reflect the change

**Visual Cue:** User is in control. Precise, professional-grade controls.

**Voiceover:**
"Disagree with a suggestion? Open the plugin and adjust. The AI gives you a starting point—a professional mastering engineer's recommendation—but you dial it in exactly how you want it. Full precision control. Full creative control."

---

#### SHOT 4B: Multi-Stem Overview (2:30-2:45)
**Action:**
- Click on the "MULTI" tab at the top of the interface
- Show the Multi-Stem Workspace loading with 3-4 stem files (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Keys)
- Each stem has its own metrics panel and analysis
- Show a quick glance at per-stem suggestions
- Briefly show the stem mixer (visual representation of stems)
- Return to SINGLE tab

**Visual Cue:** Professional workflow. Handles complexity.

**Voiceover:**
"Work with full mixes. Work with stems. The platform adapts. Analyze and master individual stems or full mixes—same precision, same AI collaboration, same human control."

---

### SECTION 5: EXPANDING POSSIBILITIES (2:45-3:00)

#### SHOT 5A: AI Studio & EVE (2:45-3:00)
**Action:**
- Click on "AI_STUDIO" tab (briefly show the interface)
- Show the AI generation interface with voice model selection and song generation controls
- Quick transition to "VIDEO" tab (EVE - Echo Video Engine)
- Show a brief clip of video with synchronized audio enhancement
- Final fade to Echo Sound Lab branding

**Visual Cue:** Breadth of platform. Multiple modalities.

**Voiceover:**
"But that's just the foundation. Generate music with AI Studio. Enhance video with EVE. One platform. Infinite possibilities. All governed by the same principle: AI proposes, you approve, you control the output."
