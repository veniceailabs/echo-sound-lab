SECTION 3: CONSENT MECHANICS — Three Options

================================================================================

OPTION A (Explicit-Action-First)

Emphasis: Nothing happens without affirmative, scoped "yes." Silence is always "no."

================================================================================

## 3) Consent Mechanics

Consent in ADAM is an event, not a setting. It is explicit, scoped, and required before
every A2 action.

### What Counts as Consent

Valid consent requires all four elements. If any is missing, the action does not proceed:

1. **What** — The specific action being taken (e.g., "submit to indie.run playlist curator")
2. **Where** — The exact surface/target (e.g., "The Experimental Archive Discord community")
3. **For How Long** — Time-bounded scope (e.g., "this release only" or "this submission batch")
4. **How to Undo** — Clear path to revoke or delete (e.g., "remove submission" or "delist from playlist")

Before any A2 action, ADAM presents these four elements to the artist and waits for explicit
"yes" to proceed. If the artist does not affirmatively say yes to all four, ADAM does not act.

### What Never Counts as Consent

The following are explicitly NOT consent, no matter how they appear:

- **Silence** — Artist does not respond, ignores the prompt, or leaves the app
- **Continued Use** — Artist keeps using ESL without disabling ADAM
- **Past Approval** — Artist approved routing yesterday, so something different today
- **Default Acceptance** — Artist didn't click "no," so we assume "yes"
- **"Recommended" Actions** — ADAM recommending something, then proceeding without explicit approval
- **Continued Inaction** — Artist sees a suggestion and does nothing
- **Ambient Settings** — General ADAM enablement ("ADAM is on") does not authorize specific actions

Inaction is always treated as refusal. Always.

### The Consent Moment (Mechanics)

Every A2 action follows this flow:

1. ADAM generates a routing plan (A0/A1)
2. ADAM presents specific action with all four consent elements visible
3. ADAM waits for explicit "Yes to [specific action at specific target for specific duration]"
4. Artist says yes, no, or revokes
5. Only "yes" proceeds. "No" or silence = ADAM stops and does nothing

The artist can:
- Say "yes" to this action only
- Say "yes" to a batch of similar actions (all listed explicitly)
- Say "no" (ADAM stops, nothing happens)
- Revoke an earlier "yes" (action is canceled before execution or undone after)

Nothing auto-advances. No timers. No "continue unless canceled."

### What Inaction Looks Like

If an artist does not consent:
- No error message
- No warning
- No "you missed an opportunity"
- No degraded experience
- No nagging to reconsider

ADAM shows: "Ready to route if you approve. Paused otherwise."

That's it. The artist can return whenever they're ready, or never. Both are valid.

### Consent Expiration

Consent is scoped to a specific action. Once that action is complete (submitted, failed,
expired as a deadline), the consent ends. ADAM does not retain blanket permission.

If an artist wants the same routing to happen again for a new release, new consent is required.
This is not friction. This is clarity.

### Revocation (Immediate & Lossless)

An artist can revoke consent at any time before or after an action. Revocation:
- Takes effect immediately
- Cancels pending actions
- Undoes completed actions where possible (deletes submissions, delists from playlists)
- Requires no explanation or justification
- Carries no penalty or warning language

Revocation is as simple as "stop" or "undo." That's all.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if an artist says "just route everything automatically," ADAM will not:
- Proceed without per-action explicit consent
- Treat silence as approval
- Use past consent to justify new actions
- Create a "set and forget" mode
- Assume consent from continued use

These are not restrictions we might relax. They are architectural.

### Binding Statement

Consent is an event, not a state. Absence of refusal is never consent. ADAM acts only when
the artist has affirmatively said yes to a specific action, at a specific target, for a
specific duration, with a clear undo path. Everything else is inaction.

================================================================================

OPTION B (Temporal & Reversible Consent)

Emphasis: Consent expires. Consent is temporary, contextual, reversible by default.

================================================================================

## 3) Consent Mechanics

Consent in ADAM is temporary, contextual, and reversible. It is never persistent, ambient,
or carried forward from one action to another.

### Anatomy of Consent

Valid consent has four required components:

1. **Scope** — What action (submit, list, enable support path)
2. **Target** — Where the action goes (specific playlist, curator, surface)
3. **Duration** — How long it lasts (single action / until sunset / X days)
4. **Reversibility** — How to undo it (delete, unlist, disable, revoke)

All four must be explicit and visible before consent is granted. Missing any one means
the action does not proceed.

### Consent Is Temporary

ADAM consent is bounded by:
- **Completion** — Consent ends when the action completes (submission sent, listing live)
- **Deadline** — Consent ends at a date/time specified by artist or system
- **Revocation** — Artist revokes consent before or after action

After any of these, ADAM reverts to A0/A1 (observe/suggest). New consent is required for
new actions.

### Consent Reversion (Default State)

The default state of ADAM after any action is complete is:
- All consent expired
- All permissions revoked
- ADAM back to observe/suggest (A0/A1)
- Artist must re-consent to enable new actions

This is not "requiring re-opt-in for everything." This is "each action stands alone."

### Temporal Examples

**Example 1: Single Action**
- Artist consents to "submit to Bedroom Pop Collective Discord"
- Submission sent
- Consent ends
- ADAM stops and reports what happened
- No further action without new consent

**Example 2: Time-Bounded Consent**
- Artist consents to "enable direct support links for 14 days"
- Links go live
- At day 15, consent expires
- Links disable automatically
- Artist receives calm notification, can re-enable if they want

**Example 3: Batch Consent**
- Artist consents to "submit to these 3 playlists" (all listed explicitly)
- All 3 submissions sent over next 48 hours
- At completion, all consent expires
- ADAM stops

**Example 4: Revocation**
- Artist consents to "keep submitted to Experimental Music Hub"
- Days later, artist revokes
- Submission is deleted/unlisted
- Consent ends immediately
- No resume, no "are you sure," no penalty

### What Silence Means (Temporal Edition)

If an artist doesn't respond to a consent request:
- ADAM does not auto-advance after time passes
- ADAM does not assume "yes" because days have elapsed
- ADAM does not treat continued use as renewal of old consent
- Silence remains no. Indefinitely.

### Revocation Semantics

Revocation is instantaneous and complete:
- Artist clicks "revoke" or "undo"
- Action is deleted/undone where possible
- Consent ends
- ADAM returns to A0/A1
- Artist experiences zero friction

Revocation never says: "This might impact…" or "Are you sure?" or "You might miss…"
It just works.

### Post-Expiration Behavior

When consent expires (by completion, deadline, or revocation):
- ADAM does not re-request the same action
- ADAM does not suggest similar actions as a refresh
- ADAM does not create urgency around renewal
- Artist sees a calm summary: "That action is complete. Ready to help when you are."

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if an artist says "keep this permission active indefinitely," ADAM will not:
- Create persistent, open-ended consent
- Carry consent from one action to a different surface
- Treat expired consent as renewable without new explicit approval
- Use time passage to assume renewed intent

Consent is always time-bounded. Always.

### Binding Statement

Consent expires by default. No consent persists beyond its action. Every new action requires
new consent. Revocation is immediate and lossless. ADAM never maintains standing permission
to act without fresh, explicit approval for each new action.

================================================================================

OPTION C (Artist-Centered Cognitive Safety)

Emphasis: No nudging, no urgency, calm optional consent. Consent should never feel like a trap.

================================================================================

## 3) Consent Mechanics

Consent in ADAM must be framed in a way that reduces anxiety, protects autonomy, and
treats the artist as a human being, not a conversion funnel.

### What Valid Consent Includes

Before any A2 action, the artist must see:

1. **What** — Specific action being proposed
2. **Where** — Exact target surface
3. **Duration** — How long this will be active/ongoing
4. **Undo** — Clear path to stop or reverse

All four must be visible. All four must be optional to choose. The artist must feel safe
saying no.

### The Consent Framing (Psychology)

ADAM consent moments are designed to:

✅ **Do This:**
- Present information neutrally
- Offer genuine choice
- Make silence/no feel safe
- Normalize low activity
- Assume the artist knows what they want
- Frame the artist as decision-maker

❌ **Never Do This:**
- Use urgency ("now," "before it's too late," "limited time")
- Use social proof ("most artists do this," "trending")
- Use fear ("you might miss out," "opportunity window")
- Use optimization language ("better chance if," "maximize reach")
- Use shame ("are you really not interested?")
- Use gamification ("unlock," "level up," "boost")
- Assume the artist needs help deciding

The tone is always: "Here's an option. You decide."

### Consent Language (Examples)

**Good consent framing:**
- "I found a match. Want to see it?"
- "This playlist takes submissions. You can approve or skip."
- "If you approve, I'll submit tomorrow. You can cancel anytime."
- "No activity is completely fine. Routing is optional."

**Bad consent framing (never use):**
- "Don't miss this opportunity."
- "Most successful artists use this routing."
- "This window closes in 3 days."
- "Enable this feature to get better results."
- "Are you sure you don't want to try this?"

### Consent UI Principles

**Principle 1: No Defaults**
- No pre-checked boxes
- No "approve by default" states
- No assumed preferences
- Consent is always an active choice

**Principle 2: No Timers**
- No countdown clocks pressuring decision
- No "this expires" language to create urgency
- Artist can think, leave, return, decide whenever

**Principle 3: No Penalty for No**
- Saying "no" does not create warnings
- Saying "no" does not degrade experience
- Saying "no" is equally valid as "yes"
- Inaction is completely safe

**Principle 4: Calm Language**
- No marketing speak
- No urgency verbs
- No fear-based framing
- Information is presented flatly

**Principle 5: Visibility of Undo**
- Before saying yes, artist sees how to undo
- Undo is as visible as the action
- Undo feels easy, not scary
- "You can stop this anytime" is clear

### Cognitive Load Principle

Consent should reduce anxiety, not create it. The artist should feel:
- Safe saying no
- Safe saying nothing
- Safe changing their mind
- Like ADAM is a tool serving them, not a pressure engine

### Examples of Consent Moments (Framed Right)

**Scenario 1:**
```
🎵 Your track matches these playlists:
   • Experimental Indie
   • Bedroom Pop Archive

Want to explore either one?

→ Yes, show me more
→ No, skip
```

Not: "Don't miss this! These playlists could change everything!"

---

**Scenario 2:**
```
Ready to route?

I found 3 good matches. If you approve, I'll submit tomorrow and report back.

What surfaces?
☐ Experimental Indie (approval required)
☐ Bedroom Pop Archive (no approval needed)
☐ skip for now

You can cancel anytime.
```

Not: "Maximize your reach by enabling all surfaces!"

---

**Scenario 3:**
```
Your support links are active.

Listeners can tip here: [link]
You can disable or adjust anytime.

Status: 7 supports this week
```

Not: "Keep it on to unlock more revenue!"

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if an artist says "use whatever framing you think works best," ADAM will not:
- Use urgency or fear to shape decisions
- Present options as "better" or "worse" (only "fit" or "not fit")
- Create FOMO or social proof pressure
- Assume silence means consent or optimism
- Use shame, guilt, or regret framing

Consent framing must always protect artist autonomy, even if it means slower adoption.

### Binding Statement

Consent moments must protect artist psychology and autonomy. ADAM presents choices flatly,
treats inaction as valid, makes silence safe, and never uses urgency, fear, social proof,
or shame to influence consent. The artist should always feel like the system serves them,
not the other way around.
