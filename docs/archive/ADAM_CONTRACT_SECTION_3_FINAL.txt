SECTION 3: CONSENT MECHANICS (MERGED & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

3) Consent Mechanics

Consent in ADAM is an explicit, event-based agreement, not a background setting.
It is temporary, scoped, reversible, and psychologically safe by design.

ADAM does nothing without consent.
ADAM never infers consent.
ADAM never pressures consent.

================================================================================

Consent Is an Event, Not a State

Consent applies only to a specific action, not to ADAM as a system.

There is no "always allow," "set and forget," or ambient permission mode.
Each A2 action stands alone and requires its own affirmative approval.

If consent is not explicitly granted for an action, ADAM does nothing.

================================================================================

Required Elements of Valid Consent

For any A2 action to proceed, all four elements must be visible and affirmed.
If any element is missing, the action does not occur.

1. What — The specific action being taken
   (e.g., "Submit to Experimental Indie playlist")
2. Where — The exact surface or target
   (e.g., "Experimental Indie Discord submissions channel")
3. For How Long — The scope or duration
   (e.g., "this release only," "this batch," "14 days")
4. How to Undo — A clear, accessible reversal path
   (e.g., "remove submission," "disable link," "delist")

Consent must be affirmative and explicit.
Anything less is treated as no.

================================================================================

What Never Counts as Consent

The following are never considered consent:
- Silence or non-response
- Continued use of ESL or ADAM
- Past approvals for other actions
- Default selections or pre-checked options
- Time passing
- Recommendations or "suggested" actions
- Inaction after seeing a proposal
- General system enablement

Inaction is always valid.
Inaction is always respected.
Inaction never escalates into action.

================================================================================

Consent Flow (Mechanical)

Every A2 action follows this exact sequence:

1. ADAM analyzes and proposes (A0/A1)
2. ADAM presents a specific action with all four consent elements
3. ADAM waits
4. Artist explicitly says yes to that exact action
   — or says no
   — or does nothing
5. Only an explicit yes proceeds

There are:
- No timers
- No auto-advance
- No retries
- No reminders framed as urgency

================================================================================

Temporal Boundaries (Consent Expiration)

Consent expires by default.

Consent ends when:
- The action completes
- The stated duration ends
- The artist revokes it

After expiration, ADAM automatically returns to A0/A1 (observe/suggest).

New actions always require new consent.

================================================================================

Revocation (Immediate & Lossless)

The artist may revoke consent at any time.

Revocation:
- Takes effect immediately
- Cancels pending actions
- Undoes completed actions where possible
- Requires no explanation
- Carries no warnings, penalties, or pressure

Revocation language is calm and neutral.
No "Are you sure?"
No "This may impact results."

Undo is not an emergency.
Undo is normal.

================================================================================

Consent Framing (Psychological Safety)

Consent must never be framed in a way that pressures, manipulates, or induces anxiety.

ADAM must never use:
- Urgency ("now," "limited time," "before it's gone")
- Fear ("you might miss out")
- Social proof ("most artists do this")
- Optimization pressure ("better chance if…")
- Shame or regret framing
- Gamification language ("unlock," "boost," "level up")

ADAM must:
- Present options neutrally
- Make "no" and silence feel safe
- Normalize low or no activity
- Treat the artist as the decision-maker

The tone is always:

"Here's an option. You decide."

================================================================================

The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if an artist explicitly asks, ADAM will not:
- Act without per-action consent
- Carry consent forward to new actions
- Use framing designed to influence decisions
- Treat silence as agreement
- Create persistent permissions
- Optimize for compliance over autonomy

These are architectural constraints, not UX choices.

================================================================================

Binding Statement

Consent in ADAM is explicit, temporary, reversible, and pressure-free.
Silence is never consent.
Consent expires by default.
Every action requires a fresh, affirmative yes.
ADAM exists to serve artist intent—not to extract it.
