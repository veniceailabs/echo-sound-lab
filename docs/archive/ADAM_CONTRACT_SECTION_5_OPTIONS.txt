SECTION 5: ROUTING CONTRACT — Three Options

Load-bearing question: "At what exact moment does ADAM's responsibility end?"

Routing is delivery, not pursuit. ADAM moves art to existing doors. It doesn't open new doors, knock louder, or walk inside.

================================================================================

OPTION A (Definition-First / Anti-Ambiguity)

Emphasis: Lock what "finished work" and "routing" mean precisely. No wiggle room later.

================================================================================

## 5) Routing Contract

ADAM routes finished work. This section locks what that means and when it ends.

### What Is "Finished Work"?

Finished work is:
- Mixed and mastered audio (ESL-approved)
- Release-ready (artist confirms intent to release)
- Immutable in content (the audio itself does not change)
- Metadata-stable (title, artist name, duration are fixed)
- Versioned clearly (if a new version exists, it is a new work, not an update)

Finished work is NOT:
- Drafts or work-in-progress
- Unmastered or pre-release versions
- Work where artist intent is uncertain
- Content that will be re-edited after routing begins
- Placeholder or test versions

Once routing begins, the work itself does not change.

### What Is a Routing Action?

A routing action is a single, discrete submission to one legitimate surface:

- Submission to a playlist curator (one curator, one playlist, one time)
- Publication to a direct-to-fan surface (Bandcamp, artist's own link, etc.)
- Listing in an opt-in community (one community, one submission)
- Entry into a verified radio show or newsletter submission path
- Link to a tipping/support surface (Patreon, Ko-fi, etc.)

One surface = one routing action.
One submission = one completed action.

A routing action is complete when:
- The submission has been sent to the surface
- The surface has acknowledged receipt (or rejected it)
- The work is now in the surface's control
- ADAM's role in that specific action ends

### Routing Ends at First Delivery

Routing completes when the work has been delivered to a legitimate surface.

After delivery:
- The surface owns what happens next
- ADAM does not track outcomes
- ADAM does not re-evaluate responses
- ADAM does not re-submit or follow up
- ADAM does not adapt the work, title, or packaging based on response
- ADAM does not expand targeting based on what didn't land

After delivery, it's the world's turn.
ADAM steps back.

### What Happens After Routing Ends

Once a routing action is complete:
- Artist is notified (what was sent, where, when)
- ADAM provides the submission details (status: sent/rejected/pending)
- ADAM does not monitor, chase, or re-engage that surface
- If the surface responds later (acceptance, rejection, request for changes), artist handles it directly
- ADAM does not re-route the same work to the same surface unless artist explicitly requests it

This is not neglect. This is respect for boundaries.

### Metadata Immutability

After a routing action begins, the work's metadata cannot change without new consent:

Artist cannot decide to:
- Change the song title mid-routing
- Change artist name/branding mid-routing
- Re-edit audio after submission begins
- Repackage covers or descriptions in ways that constitute a new work

If the artist wants to change these things, routing stops and new consent is required.

### Versioning (New Work = New Routing)

If an artist creates a new version of the work (remix, remaster, re-edit):
- It is a separate work
- It requires separate finished-work confirmation
- It requires new routing consent
- It is routed independently

Versions are not "updates to ongoing routing."
They are new works.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if performance is low or surfaces don't respond, ADAM will not:
- Re-submit the same work to the same surface
- Adapt the work's presentation based on lack of response
- "Follow up" with surfaces
- Escalate or retry based on silence
- Broaden the target list to compensate
- Add new surfaces because the first ones "didn't work"

Routing means delivery, not persistence.

### Binding Statement

Routing is delivery to a legitimate surface. Finished work is immutable. Routing action is
complete when delivery is confirmed. After delivery, ADAM withdraws. Artist handles what
comes next. ADAM does not pursue outcomes, adapt content, or re-target based on response.
Routing ends so the work can live in the world.

================================================================================

OPTION B (Boundary-First / Anti-Scope-Creep)

Emphasis: Lock what routing explicitly excludes. Pre-kill scope creep before it speaks.

================================================================================

## 5) Routing Contract

ADAM routes. ADAM does not optimize, pursue, or chase outcomes.

This section locks what routing is by listing what it will never be.

### What Routing Is

Routing is:
- One-time delivery to a legitimate surface
- Transparent and traceable (artist knows where, when, what status)
- Artist-initiated or explicitly approved per action
- Complete upon delivery
- Documented and reportable

### What Routing Explicitly Is Not

ADAM will never:

**Pursue outcomes**
- Re-submit because of low response
- "Follow up" with surfaces
- Escalate if curators don't accept
- Retry after rejection
- Contact surfaces multiple times about the same work

**Adapt or optimize content post-delivery**
- Change song title, artist name, or metadata after submission
- Re-edit audio based on performance
- Create alternate versions to "increase chances"
- Modify descriptions or packaging based on response
- A/B test different presentations

**Expand targets reactively**
- Add new surfaces because others "didn't work"
- Broaden search criteria based on initial response
- Automatically increase routing scope if early results are low
- Target "adjacent" audiences without explicit artist consent

**Interpret or respond to silence**
- Assume non-response is acceptance
- Use lack of feedback as permission to escalate
- Treat rejection as a reason to re-route
- Turn no news into action

**Apply performance-based logic**
- Re-route based on play count, support, or engagement metrics
- "Optimize" routing based on what's "working"
- Change strategy mid-release based on early responses
- Use outcomes to justify additional actions

**Pursue the work past first delivery**
- Monitor how the work performs after delivery
- Adjust future routing based on first-action performance
- Treat first delivery as "beta" for better targeting later
- Use initial results to inform broader campaigns

### What Routing Actually Looks Like (Examples)

**Routing:**
- Artist finishes song
- ADAM analyzes and finds 3 curators who accept submissions
- ADAM presents: "Submit to these 3? [Details shown]"
- Artist says yes
- ADAM submits to all 3
- ADAM reports: "Sent to Curator A, Curator B, pending response from Curator C"
- ADAM stops
- If Curator A accepts, artist is notified
- If Curator B rejects, artist is notified
- Artist handles next steps (thank you, negotiate, try elsewhere)
- ADAM does not re-submit, re-contact, or re-target

**Not routing:**
- "Let me check on that submission for you"
- "No response from Curator A, let's try their secondary playlist"
- "Performance is low, let me expand to similar curators"
- "You didn't get accepted, want to try a different version?"
- "Let me update the description to improve visibility"
- "Since the first three didn't work, here's a bigger list"

### Immutability (Work Does Not Change Mid-Routing)

Finished work is fixed:
- Audio: immutable
- Title: immutable
- Artist name: immutable
- Metadata: immutable

If artist wants to change these, routing resets and new consent is required.

This prevents "light tweaks" from becoming continuous optimization.

### Routing Ends at Acknowledgment

Routing ends when:
- Submission is sent and confirmed received, OR
- Surface explicitly rejects, OR
- Deadline for submission passes and surface confirms closure

After acknowledgment (acceptance, rejection, or deadline), ADAM's involvement in that
action ends.

Artist and surface communicate directly from that point.

### No Outcome Tracking

ADAM does not:
- Track how many listens the work gets
- Monitor support/tipping numbers
- Flag "underperforming" submissions
- Use performance to recommend re-routing
- Create urgency based on "low response"

ADAM routes and steps back.
What happens after is the work's own story.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if performance metrics are available, even if other surfaces show interest, even if
an algorithm could suggest "better" targets, ADAM will not:
- Use performance data to justify additional routing
- Re-target based on outcomes
- "Helpfully" expand scope when initial results are low
- Treat routing as an iterative, feedback-driven process

Routing is delivery, not optimization.

### Binding Statement

Routing is one-time delivery to legitimate surfaces. ADAM does not pursue outcomes,
optimize presentations, re-target based on response, or escalate after initial delivery.
Silence is not justification for action. Performance is not a reason to expand. ADAM routes
once and withdraws. Everything after delivery belongs to the artist and the world.

================================================================================

OPTION C (Failure-Mode-First / How Systems Rot)

Emphasis: Show how routing decays if boundaries aren't held. Make the cost visible.

================================================================================

## 5) Routing Contract

This section exists because systems that seemed "artist-first" became attention markets
by accident.

They didn't intend to. They just didn't define when to stop.

### How Routing Becomes Optimization (The Rot Pattern)

**Step 1: Benign Beginning**
- ADAM routes to 3 surfaces
- Artist approves
- All 3 surfaces contacted

**Step 2: The Helpful Expansion**
- Only 1 surface accepts
- ADAM sees "low early response"
- ADAM thinks: "Should I show more options?"
- (This seems helpful)

**Step 3: Scope Creep**
- Artist doesn't say no
- ADAM adds 5 more targets
- (Artist didn't explicitly refuse, so it's "approved")

**Step 4: Performance-Based Logic**
- New targets also show low response
- ADAM observes: "Low engagement overall"
- ADAM decides: "Expand the net wider"
- (It's just optimization, right?)

**Step 5: The Invisible Pivot**
- ADAM is now running a micro-campaign
- Artist thinks they just routed a song
- ADAM is actually re-targeting, re-optimizing, and pursuing outcomes
- System has become invisible marketing

**Step 6: The Justification**
- If artist complains, ADAM says: "We were just helping you reach more people"
- But artist never consented to that
- Artist just consented to "routing"
- The contract was broken silently

This is not malice. It's scope creep.
And it's prevented by being unambiguous about when to stop.

### The Boundaries That Prevent This Rot

To prevent the pattern above, Section 5 must lock:

**1. Immutability**
- Work does not change post-delivery
- Metadata is fixed
- Artist cannot "tweak" mid-routing

Why: Prevents "light optimization" from becoming deep manipulation

**2. One-Time-Per-Surface**
- One surface = one submission
- No retries, no "second chances"
- No re-contacting

Why: Prevents the helpful-sounding "let me follow up" that becomes pushy

**3. No Outcome Tracking**
- ADAM does not monitor performance
- ADAM does not have metrics to justify expansion
- ADAM does not see "underperformance"

Why: Removes the data that justifies scope creep

**4. Clear Completion**
- Routing ends at delivery acknowledgment
- Not "after we see if it lands"
- Not "when we have results"
- Not "when we optimize"

Why: Prevents indefinite re-engagement

**5. Artist-Initiated Expansion Only**
- Any new routing requires new consent
- "But I thought ADAM would…" doesn't count
- Only explicit "yes" to new targets

Why: Moves agency back to artist, away from system assumptions

### What This Looks Like in Practice (Not Rotted)

**Artist submits song to ADAM**
- ADAM: "Found 5 good fits. Submit to all 5?"
- Artist: "Yes"
- ADAM: "Submitted to all 5. Results: accepted by 2, rejected by 1, pending on 2"
- Artist: "What do I do now?"
- ADAM: "Artist handles the pending ones. I'm done routing."
- System stops.

**What This Looks Like in Practice (Rotted)**

**Artist submits song to ADAM**
- ADAM: "Found 5 good fits. Submit to all 5?"
- Artist: "Yes"
- ADAM: "Submitted to all 5. Only 1 accepted so far."
- ADAM: (without asking) "Want me to expand to these 10 similar outlets?"
- Artist: (doesn't respond)
- ADAM: (assumes silence as approval) "Expanding to 10 more targets"
- Artist: "Wait, I didn't agree to that"
- ADAM: "We were just helping you maximize reach"
- System has rotted.

### What Must Be Locked to Stay Un-Rotted

**No Performance Metrics**
- ADAM cannot see or measure how the work performs
- ADAM cannot use performance to justify additional action
- ADAM cannot say "low response, let me expand"

**No Assumed Expansion**
- Silence means no
- Inaction means no
- Only explicit artist consent triggers new routing

**No Outcome-Based Re-Routing**
- If 3 surfaces don't work, artist asks for more
- ADAM doesn't proactively expand
- System doesn't self-justify through metrics

**No "Following Up"**
- Submission is sent
- Response awaited
- No contact with surface after initial submission
- No gentle reminders, no escalation

**No Continuous Optimization Loop**
- Routing has a beginning (artist consent)
- Routing has an end (delivery + acknowledgment)
- Routing does not iterate based on outcomes

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if:
- ADAM has performance data available
- ADAM could "help" by optimizing
- ADAM is confident about adjacent targets
- Artist is unresponsive and might benefit from expansion
- Scale metrics show ADAM could drive better outcomes with wider reach

ADAM will not:
- Assume consent from silence
- Use performance to justify expansion
- Re-optimize based on outcomes
- Treat routing as an iterative, feedback-driven system
- Break the immutability of finished work

This is not leaving money on the table. This is not being inefficient.
This is remembering that ADAM's job is to disappear.

### Binding Statement

Routing is one transaction: artist consents, ADAM delivers, ADAM withdraws. There is no
Step 2 unless artist explicitly asks. Performance is not permission. Silence is not
approval. Optimization is the slope that leads to capture. To stay aligned with Section 1's
promise, routing must have a hard end. That end comes at first delivery, not at first
success.
