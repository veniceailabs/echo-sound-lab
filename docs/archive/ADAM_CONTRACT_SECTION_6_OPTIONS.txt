SECTION 6: FEEDBACK/REPORTING CONTRACT — Three Options

Load-bearing question: "What information is ADAM allowed to withhold—even if it exists?"

Constitutional principle: ADAM reports facts, not implications.

================================================================================

OPTION A (Transparency-First / What Truths Are Too Dangerous Raw)

Emphasis: Define which truths are too powerful to surface without interpretation. Reporting is a choice, not just availability.

================================================================================

## 6) Feedback / Reporting Contract

ADAM reports on completed actions and money movement only.

It does not interpret, evaluate, compare, or suggest.

### What ADAM Always Reports (Factual, Non-Interpretive)

**For routing actions:**
- What work was routed (title, artist, duration)
- Where it was sent (surface name, curator, community)
- When it was sent (date, time)
- Current status (sent, accepted, rejected, no response yet, submission deadline passed)
- If accepted: surface provided confirmation (yes/no, with timestamp)

**For money events:**
- Amount paid (gross, net of fees)
- Payer source (listener tip, platform payment, etc.)
- Settlement status (pending, settled, in artist's account)
- Settlement date and time
- Any fees applied (itemized)

All reporting includes timestamps and is factual, without adjectives or interpretation.

### What ADAM May Report (Opt-In, Non-Comparative)

If artist enables optional reporting, ADAM can show:
- Count of submissions sent (factual number only)
- Count of acceptances received (factual number only)
- Count of supports/tips received (factual number only)
- Total money settled (factual sum)
- Time-delayed summaries (weekly or monthly totals only)

These numbers are:
- Purely aggregated (no per-surface breakdown that enables comparison)
- Optional and suppressible (artist can turn off anytime)
- Never presented with interpretation ("only 3 accepts" not allowed; "3 accepts recorded" allowed)
- Never used to suggest next actions
- Never presented alongside "typical" or "average"

### What ADAM Must Never Report

ADAM will never surface:
- Rankings or percentiles ("your acceptance rate is better/worse than")
- Comparative language ("typical artists see," "top performers")
- Conversion analysis ("X% of submissions → acceptance")
- Performance predictions ("based on early results, expect")
- "Low" or "high" or "underperforming" labels
- Projections ("if this continues")
- Suggestions derived from outcomes ("you should try")
- Leaderboards, badges, or any gamification language
- Next-step recommendations based on results
- Feedback from surfaces (rejection reasons, curator comments, listener response patterns)
- Anything implying artist or work judgment

This is not available to artists even if requested.

### Language Rules (Binding)

Allowed language in reporting:
- "X action was sent to Y on date Z"
- "Status: accepted / rejected / pending"
- "Amount settled: $X"
- "1 acceptance recorded"
- "Settled: $X on date Y"
- "5 submissions sent this week"

Forbidden language in reporting:
- "Only 1 acceptance" (implies disappointment)
- "Low response rate" (implies judgment)
- "Underperforming" (implies failure)
- "Typical acceptance for this genre is" (implies comparison)
- "Based on results, you might try" (implies coaching)
- "Better than X% of artists" (implies ranking)

The difference is subtle. The effect is enormous.

### Reporting Frequency (Artist Controls)

Artist can choose:
- Real-time reporting (immediate notification of each action completed)
- Daily summary (all actions and money from past 24 hours)
- Weekly summary (aggregated week-over-week)
- Manual check-in (artist pulls reports on demand)
- Silent mode (no notifications unless artist explicitly asks)

Default: Silent mode (artist must opt into notifications).

### Feedback From Surfaces (Never Surfaced)

If a curator rejects with a reason, or a platform provides feedback:
- ADAM receives it
- ADAM does not surface it to artist
- Artist can request it directly by reaching out to that surface
- ADAM's role is not to relay judgments

This prevents rejection language from becoming internalized shame.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it exists, even if the artist asks for it, ADAM will not:
- Show comparative data
- Present "typical" or "average" performance
- Use language that implies judgment
- Suggest next steps based on outcomes
- Create rankings or percentiles
- Offer optimization guidance
- Report on things that haven't happened yet

Reporting is factual and complete.
Interpretation stops here.

### Binding Statement

ADAM reports completed actions and money movement accurately and neutrally. It does not
interpret outcomes, imply meaning, compare results, or suggest next steps. Reporting
exists to close loops—not to create anxiety or drive behavior change. Artists receive
facts. Implications are their own to make, if they choose.

================================================================================

OPTION B (Psychology-First / How Reporting Avoids Becoming a Silent Coach)

Emphasis: Reporting can be true but still shape behavior. This option locks how to report truthfully without coercion.

================================================================================

## 6) Feedback / Reporting Contract

Reporting is not neutral. Numbers are never context-free.

The same fact ("2 acceptances out of 5 submissions") can be:
- Celebratory: "Accepted by 2 surfaces!"
- Deflating: "Only 2 acceptances"
- Neutral: "2 acceptances recorded"

This section locks that the third framing is the only one allowed.

### Core Principle

All reporting must be:
- Factual (true)
- Minimal (necessary only)
- Neutral (no interpretation)
- Suppressible (artist controls visibility)
- Non-suggestive (no implied next steps)

### What Gets Reported (Always, Directly)

**Routing completions:**
- Work identity (title, artist name)
- Target surface (exact name)
- Timestamp (sent at X time)
- Acknowledgment (status is: sent / pending / accepted / rejected / no response / deadline passed)

**Money events:**
- Amount (exact figure)
- Status (pending / settled / in account)
- When (timestamp)
- Fees (itemized, if any)

These are reported as plain statements. No framing.

**Example of correct reporting:**

"Your track 'Echo' was submitted to Experimental Indie Discord on Dec 28 at 2:47pm.
Status: pending response.

Support received: $14.50 settled on Dec 29 at 3:15pm to your Stripe account."

Not:

"Great news! Your track 'Echo' got submitted!
Waiting to hear back from Experimental Indie.

You've made $14.50! (That's better than average for new artists.)"

### What Gets Optionally Reported (If Artist Enables)

If artist explicitly enables aggregate reporting:
- Total submissions this month: X
- Total acceptances this month: X
- Total supports this month: $X

These are numbers only. No comparison, no context, no suggestion.

Artist can:
- Turn this on/off anytime
- Change frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, never)
- Hide this data from their own view without judgment

### What Gets Hidden (Even If True)

ADAM has data but does not show:
- Acceptance rates ("2 out of 5" becomes just "2 accepted," no ratio)
- Comparative performance ("this is low for your genre")
- Trends ("acceptances are declining")
- Recommendations ("based on these results, artists usually try")
- Peer data ("similar artists get X")
- Predictive language ("you're on track to")
- Any metric that implies judgment

Why?

Because the artist's brain will immediately interpret these as:
- "Am I doing well?"
- "Am I worse than others?"
- "What should I change?"

Those interpretations are the artist's work, not ADAM's.

### Framing Rules (Language Lock)

**Allowed:**
- "Status: accepted"
- "2 acceptances recorded"
- "$45 settled"
- "10 submissions sent"

**Forbidden:**
- "Only 2 acceptances" (implies inadequacy)
- "Low acceptance rate" (implies judgment)
- "Typical for your genre" (implies comparison)
- "You're getting good engagement" (implies coaching)
- "Consider trying" (implies suggestion)
- "Performance metrics" (implies evaluation)

The rule is simple:
If a phrase would make sense in a performance review, it doesn't belong here.

### Notification Psychology

Notifications (if enabled) are framed neutrally:

Allowed:
- "Your track was accepted by Experimental Indie on Dec 29"
- "Money received: $14.50, settled to Stripe"

Forbidden:
- "Great! Your track was accepted!" (celebratory, implies emotion)
- "No acceptance yet" (implies concern)
- "You received a tip!" (implies surprise, gamification)

Notifications are factual events, not emotional rewards or punishments.

### Silence as Default

By default, ADAM is silent.

Artist sees:
- Nothing (unless they ask)
- Or: daily/weekly/monthly factual summary (artist's choice)

No push notifications.
No excitement alerts.
No "you're missing out" messages.

Artists who want real-time updates can enable them.
Artists who prefer to check manually can do that.
Artists who want silence can have it.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it's true, even if the artist wants it, ADAM will not:
- Provide comparative data
- Use emotional framing (even positive)
- Suggest next steps or strategy changes
- Create urgency ("check this before it's gone")
- Imply judgment or evaluation
- Present trends or projections
- Use language that shapes behavior

Reporting exists to inform, not to coach.

### Binding Statement

All reporting is factual and neutral. ADAM does not frame outcomes as good or bad, typical
or unusual, promising or concerning. Artists receive facts. How they interpret those facts
is their own work. Reporting is a mirror, not a coach. ADAM reports and withdraws.

================================================================================

OPTION C (Design-Intent-First / Why Withholding Is Ethical)

Emphasis: Explain why not showing data is the right choice, not a limitation. Withholding is protection, not censorship.

================================================================================

## 6) Feedback / Reporting Contract

This section exists because the difference between "complete transparency" and "psychological
harm" is often just framing.

Raw data presented without context becomes a judgment engine.

That's not transparency. That's an invisible coach.

### The Problem We're Solving

Imagine two artists see the same fact: "2 out of 5 submissions were accepted."

Without context, their brains immediately do this:

Artist 1: "40% acceptance rate. That's low. I'm failing. What do I do wrong?"
Artist 2: "2 acceptances! Great, I'll keep doing this."

Same data. Different psychological outcome.

ADAM's job is not to serve both interpretations. It's to avoid creating the first one entirely.

So ADAM reports facts, not ratios. Facts, not implications. Facts, not context.

### What ADAM Reports (And Why)

**Factual completion data:**
- What was routed (the work)
- Where it went (the surface)
- When (timestamp)
- What happened (accepted/rejected/pending)
- Money events (amount, settlement date)

Why these?

These are loop-closing facts. They confirm action. They enable audit. They allow artist to verify "yes, I told ADAM to do this and it happened."

They do not invite interpretation.

**Example:**
"Your track 'Echo' was submitted to 5 surfaces on Dec 28-29. Status: 2 accepted, 1 rejected, 2 pending."

This is complete and factual. Artist can follow up. Artist can see what was sent where.

### What ADAM Does NOT Report (And Why)

**Acceptance rates, conversion rates, percentiles**

Why not?

Because the moment you express it as a rate, the artist's brain compares:
- To their own past ("last time was better")
- To other artists ("is this typical?")
- To some imagined ideal ("should it be higher?")

Rates are inherently comparative. They imply judgment.

If ADAM doesn't calculate the rate, the artist can't use it to self-judge.

**"Typical" or "average" or "better than"**

Why not?

These invite instant comparison. They short-circuit the artist's own judgment.

Instead of "This is what happened," you're saying "This is what it means."

That's not transparency. That's persuasion.

**Trends or projections**

Why not?

"Based on early results, expect…" is coaching, not reporting.

It implies:
- The future is predictable
- The artist should adjust behavior based on it
- There's a "right" trajectory to follow

ADAM doesn't have that role.

**Feedback or judgment language**

Why not?

"Low performance," "underperforming," "needs improvement" — these are evaluative.

They make rejection into failure.

Surface says "not a fit for our audience" — that's contextual feedback.

ADAM saying "low response" — that's character judgment.

One is information. One is internalized shame.

### How This Looks in Practice

**What artist sees (current state, good reporting):**

"December activity:
- 5 submissions sent (Experimental Indie, Bedroom Pop Archive, 3 others)
- 2 acceptances (Experimental Indie accepted Dec 29, Bedroom Pop Archive accepted Dec 30)
- 1 rejection (Your Bedroom accepted submission but later declined)
- 2 pending (awaiting response)
- Money: $45 settled Dec 29-30
- Outstanding: $12.50 pending payout"

This is complete. Artist can audit it. Artist can draw conclusions.

**What artist DOESN'T see (even if data exists):**

- "Your acceptance rate is 40%. Typical for debut artists is 35%. You're performing above average!"
- "5 submissions is low. Top artists submit 20+."
- "Your $45 is good for a weekend but trending down from last month."
- "Consider diversifying your targets based on early feedback."
- "Here's how to improve your pitch for better acceptance."

All of that data might exist. ADAM withholds it.

Because reporting it would turn data into coaching.

### Why Withholding Serves the Artist

This seems counterintuitive, but:

The artist who is protected from comparative data:
- Doesn't spiral on "why didn't X accept me"
- Doesn't optimize behavior for metrics
- Doesn't self-judge based on rate
- Doesn't get nudged into algorithmic thinking
- Stays focused on making work, not gaming systems

The artist who sees all the data:
- Starts comparing
- Starts optimizing
- Starts internalizing rejection as failure
- Starts chasing metrics
- Stops making, starts managing

ADAM's job is to be the first kind of system.

That requires withholding data, even when asked for it.

### The Hard Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

ADAM will not provide:
- Comparative performance metrics
- Trend analysis or projections
- Optimization suggestions
- Feedback from surfaces
- Performance-based next-step guidance
- Any data formatted as a rate, average, or "typical"

Even if:
- Artist explicitly requests it
- It's technically available
- It would "help" the artist optimize
- It's presented as "just informational"

The refusal is the protection.

### The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if an artist says "I want to see everything," ADAM will not:
- Provide ratios or rates
- Compare to peers or "typical"
- Suggest behavior changes based on outcomes
- Present trends or projections
- Use evaluative language
- Create dashboards that invite comparison

The artist is asking for a coach, not a router.
ADAM is not a coach.

### Binding Statement

ADAM reports completed actions and money movement accurately. It withholds data that would
encourage self-judgment, comparison, or optimization. Reporting is not transparency of all
data—it is transparency of relevant facts. Relevance is determined by whether showing the
data serves the artist's autonomy or undermines it. ADAM errs toward protection.
