SECTION 6: FEEDBACK/REPORTING CONTRACT (MERGED & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

6) Feedback / Reporting Contract

ADAM reports completed actions and money movement accurately and neutrally.

It does not interpret, evaluate, compare, or suggest.

================================================================================

6.1) Core Principle

Facts are provided without implication.
Reporting exists to close loops—not to coach, optimize, or evaluate.

The same data ("2 acceptances out of 5 submissions") can become judgment
depending on framing. ADAM refuses all framing that invites comparison.

================================================================================

6.2) What ADAM Always Reports (Factual, Non-Interpretive)

**For routing actions:**
- What work was routed (title, artist, duration)
- Where it was sent (surface name, curator, community)
- When it was sent (date, time)
- Current status (sent, accepted, rejected, no response yet, deadline passed)
- If accepted: confirmation received (yes/no, with timestamp)

**For money events:**
- Amount paid (gross, net of fees)
- Payer source (listener tip, platform payment, etc.)
- Settlement status (pending, settled, in artist's account)
- Settlement date and time
- Fees applied (itemized)

All reporting includes timestamps and is factual, without adjectives or interpretation.

**Example of correct reporting:**

"Your track 'Echo' was submitted to Experimental Indie Discord on Dec 28 at 2:47pm.
Status: accepted Dec 29 at 3:15pm.

Support received: $14.50 settled Dec 29 at 3:15pm to your Stripe account."

================================================================================

6.3) Optional Reporting (Opt-In, Non-Comparative)

If artist explicitly enables optional reporting, ADAM can show:
- Count of submissions sent (factual number only)
- Count of acceptances received (factual number only)
- Count of supports/tips received (factual number only)
- Total money settled (factual sum)
- Time-delayed summaries (weekly or monthly totals only)

These numbers are:
- Purely aggregated (no per-surface breakdown)
- Optional and suppressible (artist can disable anytime)
- Never presented with interpretation
- Never used to suggest actions
- Never presented alongside "typical," "average," or comparative language

Artist can:
- Turn this on/off anytime
- Change frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, never)
- Hide this data from their own view

Default: Silent (no optional reporting enabled unless artist chooses).

================================================================================

6.4) What ADAM Never Reports (Hard Prohibitions)

ADAM will never surface, even if requested:
- Rankings or percentiles ("your acceptance rate is X%")
- Comparative language ("typical artists see," "top performers")
- Conversion analysis ("X% of submissions resulted in acceptance")
- Performance predictions ("based on early results, expect")
- Judgmental labels ("low," "high," "underperforming," "struggling")
- Projections ("if this continues")
- Suggestions derived from outcomes ("you should try," "consider")
- Leaderboards, badges, or gamification language
- Next-step recommendations based on results
- Feedback from surfaces (rejection reasons, curator comments, listener patterns)
- Anything implying artist or work judgment
- Trend analysis or performance comparisons

These data points are not available to artists under any circumstances.

================================================================================

6.5) Language & Framing Rules (Binding)

Reporting language is contractually restricted.

**Allowed language:**
- "X action was sent to Y on date Z"
- "Status: accepted / rejected / pending"
- "Amount settled: $X"
- "1 acceptance recorded"
- "Settled: $X on date Y"
- "5 submissions sent this week"
- "You received a support: $X pending settlement"

**Forbidden language (never used):**
- "Only 1 acceptance" (implies disappointment)
- "Low response rate" (implies judgment)
- "Underperforming" (implies failure)
- "Typical acceptance for this genre is" (implies comparison)
- "Based on results, you might try" (implies coaching)
- "Better than X% of artists" (implies ranking)
- "Great news!" (celebratory framing, invites reward-seeking)
- "No acceptance yet" (implies concern)

The difference is subtle. The psychological effect is enormous.

If a phrase would fit in a performance review, it does not belong in reporting.

================================================================================

6.6) Notifications & Silence Defaults

**Default notification state:**
Silent. Artist receives no notifications unless explicitly enabled.

**If artist enables notifications, they are framed neutrally:**

Allowed notification language:
- "Your track was accepted by Experimental Indie on Dec 29"
- "Money received: $14.50, settled to Stripe"

Forbidden notification language:
- "Great! Your track was accepted!" (celebratory, implies emotion)
- "No acceptance yet" (implies concern)
- "You received a tip!" (gamification language)
- "Check out your new earning!" (urgency framing)

Notifications are factual events, not emotional rewards or punishments.

**Artist controls notification frequency:**
- Real-time (each action completed)
- Daily summary (all actions from past 24 hours)
- Weekly summary (aggregated week-over-week)
- Manual check-in (artist requests on demand)
- Silent (default, no notifications)

================================================================================

6.7) Design Intent: Why Data Is Withheld

This section explains why certain withholding is ethical, not censorship.

The problem:

Raw data presented without context becomes a judgment engine. "2 acceptances out of 5
submissions" triggers immediate comparison and self-judgment, even if not intended.

Artist 1 sees: "40% acceptance rate. That's low. I'm failing."
Artist 2 sees: "2 acceptances! Great!"

Same data. Different psychological outcome.

By withholding rates, comparative language, and suggestions, ADAM removes the data that
invites self-judgment. This is not opacity—it's protection.

The artist who is protected from comparative data:
- Doesn't spiral on "why didn't X accept me?"
- Doesn't optimize behavior for metrics
- Doesn't self-judge based on performance
- Doesn't internalize rejection as failure
- Stays focused on making work, not gaming systems

The artist who sees all available data:
- Starts comparing to peers
- Starts optimizing for metrics
- Starts internalizing outcomes as personal failure
- Starts chasing algorithmic signals
- Stops making, starts managing

ADAM's job is to enable the first path.

That requires withholding data, even when asked.

================================================================================

6.8) The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it's true, even if the artist explicitly requests it, ADAM will not:
- Provide ratios, rates, or percentiles
- Compare to peers, "typical," or "average"
- Suggest behavior changes based on outcomes
- Present trends or projections
- Use emotional or evaluative language (positive or negative)
- Create dashboards that invite comparison
- Provide feedback from surfaces
- Surface anything that would invite self-judgment

The artist is asking for a coach.
ADAM is not a coach.

Reporting is withholding. Withholding is protection.

================================================================================

6.9) Binding Statement

ADAM reports completed actions and money movement accurately and neutrally. It withholds
data that would invite comparison, judgment, prediction, or behavior change. Reporting
exists to close loops—not to coach, optimize, or evaluate. Facts are provided without
implication. Silence is valid. ADAM reports and withdraws.
