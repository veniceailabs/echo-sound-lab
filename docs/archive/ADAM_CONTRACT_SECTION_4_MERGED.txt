SECTION 4: MONEY FLOW GUARANTEE (MERGED & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

4) Money Flow Guarantee

Money is the artist's. ADAM's only role is to route it there as directly, quickly, and
transparently as possible.

This section locks how money moves and who can never touch it.

================================================================================

The Core Promise

When a listener pays through ADAM routing:

1. Artist is notified in real-time
2. Amount to artist is shown (gross and net, fees itemized)
3. Settlement happens on a predictable day (same-day or next-business-day)
4. Money reaches artist's chosen account directly or ADAM compensates for delay
5. Artist owns all data and the listener relationship

No secrecy. No delays. No extraction.

================================================================================

Who Pays, Who Gets Paid, Who Touches Money

Clarity on every transaction:

- **Payer:** The listener (identified by payment method)
- **Payee:** The artist (identified by artist account)
- **Does ADAM touch funds?** Only if artist explicitly authorizes per transaction type.
  Otherwise: money flows directly from listener to artist.

When ADAM must be in the chain (currency conversion, batch processing):
- Artist approves in writing
- Timeline is stated
- Artist can revoke anytime
- Money returns to artist if revoked

Default: Money flows around ADAM, not through it.

================================================================================

Fee Transparency (Before Any Money Moves)

Artist sees this before approving any payment method:

Listener pays: $10.00
  - Payment processor fee: $0.30
  - Platform fee (if applicable): $1.00
  - ADAM fee: $0.00
Artist receives: $8.70
Settlement: Tomorrow by 2pm

No "up to," "approximately," or "may vary."
Every fee is exact. Every timeline is certain.
Artist approves or chooses a different route.

If a payment processor's fees change, artist is notified and can disable that method.
Changes do not apply retroactively.

================================================================================

Settlement Speed (Guaranteed)

All payment paths default to:

- Direct support (tips, one-time payments): Same-day or within 24 hours
- Bank transfers: Next business day
- Special routes: Timeline stated upfront, or not offered

If a payment method cannot meet these timelines, it is not available in ADAM.

Artist sees exactly when they'll be paid before they approve routing.

No holds for "safety."
No batching minimums that delay payout.
No premium tiers for faster settlement (speed is baseline, not a feature).

================================================================================

Who Owns What

**Artist owns:**
- All payment methods and accounts (directly, not through ADAM)
- Listener data (emails, payment history, support patterns)
- The listener relationship (not transferred to ADAM or platforms)
- Right to use aggregated data for their own marketing
- Right to exit payment processing anytime

**ADAM does not:**
- Take ownership of any payment method
- Require exclusive payment processing
- Own listener data
- Bundle artist identity with payment data for resale
- Use payment information for targeting or profiling
- Claim rights to the work based on payment routing

================================================================================

Artist Control of Money Paths

Artist can:
- Choose which payment methods are available
- Change methods anytime
- Add new payment options anytime
- Set payout frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, on-demand)
- Set minimum payout thresholds (or have none)
- Exit any payment method without penalty or restriction

ADAM executes the artist's choice.
ADAM does not architect the choice.

================================================================================

Real-Time Accounting & Audit Rights

Artist can see at any time:

- Every transaction (with timestamp, payer, amount)
- Every fee broken down (what, why, how much)
- Every hold or delay (reason stated, timeline to resolution)
- What's pending, what's settled
- Running total (today, week, month)
- Proof of settlement to artist's account

If artist questions any line item, ADAM must explain it or refund it.
Audit disputes are resolved in artist's favor by default.

Artist can audit ADAM's ledger and payment processor communications anytime.

================================================================================

Chargeback & Dispute Handling

If a listener disputes a payment:

1. Artist is notified immediately
2. Dispute timeline is stated
3. Artist is not penalized for the dispute
4. If resolved in artist's favor, funds return immediately
5. If resolved against artist, artist is not charged dispute fees

Artist is not punished for listener actions.

================================================================================

The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it costs more, delays scale, or reduces adoption, ADAM will not:

- Charge a percentage-based cut
- Delay settlement beyond next business day
- Hold money without explicit per-transaction authorization
- Require exclusivity in payment processing
- Extract or monetize listener data
- Claim rights to the work or listener relationship
- Use payment delays as leverage
- Penalize artists for exiting payment processing
- Change settlement terms without artist opt-in
- Use vague or ambiguous language around fees or timing

Transparency, speed, and ownership are architectural.
These are not negotiable or relaxable.

================================================================================

Exit & Portability (Zero Friction)

Artist can:
- Remove ADAM routing anytime
- Move payment processing to another system
- Request complete data export
- Redirect future money elsewhere
- Receive zero penalty, service degradation, or retaliation

Exit is as easy as entry.
No switching costs.
No hidden holdback.

================================================================================

Binding Statement

Money is owned by the artist. Every dollar is traced end-to-end with zero hidden fees.
Settlement is same-day or next-business-day guaranteed. ADAM never touches funds without
explicit per-transaction authorization. Listener data belongs to the artist. Artist owns
the listener relationship. Artist can exit payment processing anytime without penalty.
Money flows as directly as possible from listener to artist. Everything else is clear,
transparent, and in the artist's control.
