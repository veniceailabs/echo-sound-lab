## ❓ Questions?

Check if the volume slider is turned up. We use streaming standards, so louder = more compression.

Yes! It saves automatically. When you come back, your last project is there.

**Works without internet?**
Some parts do, but AI features need internet.

**What's the difference between AI Studio and regular mode?**
Regular mode: Master an existing song. AI Studio: Create a brand new song.

**Can I use copyrighted songs?**
For testing, yes. But don't share the results without permission.
