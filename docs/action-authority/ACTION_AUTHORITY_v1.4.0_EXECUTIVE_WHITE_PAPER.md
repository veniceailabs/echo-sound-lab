## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As AI systems evolve from chatbots to agents, a critical "Liability Vacuum" has emerged. Organizations cannot safely deploy AI that possesses the power to mutate system state, move funds, or edit legal records without a deterministic proof of human intent.

Action Authority v1.4.0 is a "Hard Constraint" architecture that serves as a universal gatekeeper between AI Perception and System Execution. It replaces brittle "Safety Policies" with Mechanical Invariants, ensuring that no action is ever executed without a verifiable, contemporaneous human authorization.

---

## 1. THE FIVE LEVELS OF SOVEREIGNTY

### Level 0: Mechanical Intent (Physical Safety)

The core of the system is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that decouples Prediction from Permission.

**The 400ms Invariant:** Execution is physically impossible without a continuous human input hold of ≥400ms. This provides a neurological buffer against "Reflexive Automation Bias."

**FSM Isolation:** The AI Perception Layer has 0% authority to transition state. Only human events can reach the EXECUTED state.

### Level 1: The Trust Network (Cryptographic Integrity)

Every authorized action is recorded in a Chronological Forensic Ledger.

**Hash-Chaining:** Each entry contains a SHA-256 hash of the previous entry.

**Tamper Detection:** It is mathematically impossible to delete or re-order the history of AI actions without breaking the chain, ensuring non-repudiation in legal disputes.

### Level 2: Collaborative Authority (Institutional Governance)

High-stakes actions (e.g., deleting project files, final legal filings) are geofenced by risk.

**Multi-Sig Quorum:** "HIGH" risk actions require a co-signature from two independent authorized sessions.

**Consensus Gate:** The system serves as a "Two-Man Rule" for digital execution, preventing single-point-of-failure human error or compromise.

### Level 3: Governed Autonomy (Operational Speed)

To support high-velocity professional workflows, the system provides a "Speed Throttle."

**Authority Leases:** A human can "Lease" their intent to the AI for a specific domain and time window.

**Dead Man's Switch:** The lease requires a 50ms "Heartbeat." If the human disengages (lifts their finger or closes the window), the lease is instantly revoked, and the system reverts to the 400ms manual gate.

### Level 4: Contextual Reasoning (Ethical Safety)

The Vault is "Policy-Aware."

**Semantic Gating:** A deterministic PolicyEngine scans the meaning of an AI suggestion before it reaches the HUD.

**Hard Prohibitions:** Any intent involving PII exposure, unauthorized API calls, or root-system mutation is auto-expired before the user can even attempt to authorize it.

### Level 5: Quantum Hardening (Temporal Sovereignty)

The system is protected against the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat.

**Hybrid Anchoring:** The ledger supports parallel signatures (Classical + Post-Quantum).

**PQC Ready:** Structural support for NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) ensures that today's intent logs remain legally valid into the 2030s and beyond.

---

## 2. THE 14 ARCHITECTURAL AMENDMENTS

The system is governed by 14 non-negotiable code invariants (A-N), including:

**Amendment H (Confidence Invariance):** AI confidence scores are telemetry only; they never grant execution authority.

**Amendment K (Remediation Invariance):** Safety warnings in the HUD must be static strings, preventing AI "Gaslighting."

**Amendment N (Sovereignty Clause):** The system never overrides a human command; it only witnesses and validates it.

---

## 3. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT MATRIX

Action Authority v1.4.0 provides a "Turn-Key" compliance solution for:

**GDPR Article 22:** Satisfies the right to human intervention in automated processing.

**NIST AI RMF 1.0:** Directly implements the "Govern, Map, Measure, Manage" functions.

**SOC 2 Type II:** Provides immutable proof of data processing integrity.

---

## 4. THE UNIVERSAL BRIDGE

Action Authority is application-agnostic. It can be deployed as the governance spine for:

- **Audio/Video Production:** (Logic Pro X, Final Cut Pro)
- **Legal & Enterprise:** (Microsoft Word, Case Management, Web Browsers)
- **System Operations:** (Cloud Infrastructure, File Systems)

---

## 5. CONCLUSION

Action Authority v1.4.0 defines the transition from AI as an Agent to AI as an Assistant. By enforcing a mechanical gate between suggestion and action, we return Sovereignty to the Human and Accountability to the System.

**"Unsafe behavior is not discouraged; it is rendered physically impossible."**
