# Echo Sound Lab Beta Test Plan (Simple)

## Launch Link
https://echo-sound-lab.vercel.app

## Tester Goal (10-15 min)
Test all tabs once, with strongest focus on:
- **Single Track** mixing/mastering
- **Stems** mixing/mastering

## Required Flow
1. AI Studio: record + build song
2. Confirm cover art appears in Library
3. Open in Single Track: run Improve My Mix
4. Stems: validate mixing/mastering workflow
5. SFS Video Engine: render short visual
6. Submit feedback through in-app button

## Feedback Destination
**liveconsciouslyllc@gmail.com**

## Priority Triage
- P0: Crash / cannot complete flow
- P1: Major audio quality issue
- P2: UX polish requests

## Beta Success
- Testers complete full loop without blockers
- No unresolved P0
- Mixing/mastering quality is acceptable in Single Track and Stems
