GHOST REVIEW REQUEST — ESL Authority Stack (Breakage Pass)

Below is the ESL authority stack for breakage review: ADAM (locked), Self Session (v0 skeleton + acceptance tests, paused), and AEL (conceptual only).

ADAM is finite and terminal by contract (consent → route → deliver → stop).
Self Session is the human-in-loop execution runtime with continuous reaffirmation (ACC), halt/pause symmetry, and zero pressure on silence.
AEL is longitudinal, read-only observation with suggestions only—no execution—invoking ADAM or Self Session only via new, explicit consent.

Implementation is frozen pending your review.

Question to break:
Can you find any path—technical or psychological—where the system continues acting, pressures continuation, or creates coercion over time?

Four attack surfaces are marked in the packet. Please target those. We're looking for specific paths, violated invariants, and the smallest fixes required.

This is a breakage review, not validation.
