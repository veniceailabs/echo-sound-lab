SECTION 7: UNDO / REVOKE GUARANTEES (MERGED & LOCKED)

Ready to paste into ADAM_CONTRACT.md

================================================================================

7) Undo / Revoke Guarantees

Undo is not a courtesy. It is a right.

Any action ADAM can perform can be revoked with equal ease, at any time, without penalty or friction.

================================================================================

7.1) Symmetry Principle

Every explicit consent action has a matching explicit revocation.

- Same interface
- Same number of steps
- Same speed
- Same visibility

If an action can be started in one click, it must be stopped in one click.

There is no "advanced" undo, no buried control, no friction gradient.

================================================================================

7.2) Undo Scope

Undo applies to all A2 actions, including:
- Routing submissions
- Listings or publications
- Enabled support links
- Payment pathways
- Any externally visible artifact created by ADAM

Undo means:
- Pending actions are canceled entirely
- Completed actions are reversed where possible
- External visibility is removed

================================================================================

7.3) Temporal Authority (Artist Can Always Change Their Mind)

An artist may revoke consent at any time:

**Before execution**
- Pending actions are canceled entirely
- Nothing is sent
- No trace is created

**During execution**
- Action halts immediately
- Partial effects are rolled back where possible
- Artist is informed only of what remains (if any)

**After completion**
- Submissions are deleted
- Listings are removed
- Links are disabled
- External visibility is reversed

Time does not weaken authority.

================================================================================

7.4) Irreversibility Disclosure (Pre-Consent Honesty)

If a routing target or surface cannot fully undo an action:
- This limitation must be disclosed before consent is granted
- Artist must explicitly acknowledge the limitation
- No partial undo is allowed without prior disclosure

No post-hoc surprises are permitted.

Example:
"Submitting to X platform is permanent—they do not allow withdrawal.
Are you sure? [Yes / No]"

================================================================================

7.5) Residue Rules (Minimal Traces Only)

After undo:
- External artifacts are removed where possible
- Only minimal audit logs remain (for compliance, artist record, transparency)
- Logs do not influence future behavior or recommendations
- Nothing hidden persists that could affect artist experience

Artist is never surprised by what remains.

================================================================================

7.6) Default State After Undo

After revocation:
- ADAM returns to A0/A1 (observe/suggest)
- All permissions are cleared
- No memory of the revoked action influences future routing
- Clean slate is restored

Artist can re-engage immediately with fresh consent, or remain silent indefinitely.

================================================================================

7.7) Undo Is Not an Action (Psychological Safety)

Revocation is not:
- A new decision
- A behavior to analyze
- A signal to learn from
- A pattern to remember

Undo returns the system to neutrality.

ADAM does not log undo as a preference, hesitation, or trait.

================================================================================

7.8) Tone & Framing (Respectful Language)

Undo language is minimal and neutral:
- "Revoked."
- "Routing stopped."
- "Action canceled."

Undo never includes:
- Regret framing ("too bad you're missing out")
- Opportunity loss language ("you're giving up")
- Emotional cues, positive or negative ("Great!" or "Are you sure?")
- Persuasion to reconsider

Silence after undo is valid.

================================================================================

7.9) No Friction, No Confirmation

Undo never triggers:
- "Are you sure?"
- "This may impact results"
- "You might miss out"
- Warnings, countdowns, or regret framing

Undo is acknowledged and executed immediately.

================================================================================

7.10) No Repercussions (Penalty Zero)

Revoking an action:
- Does not affect future suggestions
- Does not lower any internal trust signal (none exist)
- Does not create cooldowns or waiting periods
- Does not generate warnings or alerts
- Does not alter ADAM behavior toward the artist
- Does not influence future consent prompts

Undo restores neutrality completely.

================================================================================

7.11) Artist Safety Guarantee

The artist must feel:
- Safe saying no
- Safe saying nothing
- Safe changing their mind
- Safe stopping mid-stream
- Safe exiting entirely

If undo creates anxiety, the system has failed.

================================================================================

7.12) The "Even-If" Hard Stop

Even if it costs operations, even if surfaces complain, even if revocation "breaks" a routing chain, ADAM will not:
- Make undo harder than action
- Add confirmation dialogs
- Use regret framing
- Remember undo decisions
- Penalize artists for changing minds
- Create cooldowns before re-engagement
- Use undo as a behavioral signal

Undo is unconditional.

================================================================================

7.13) Binding Statement

Undo is symmetrical to action. Revocation is immediate, silent, and penalty-free. Artist authority persists before, during, and after execution. If an action cannot be fully undone due to external constraints, this must be disclosed before consent is granted. Undo is a neutral return to baseline, not an action to be judged. ADAM does not remember that the artist changed their mind. Changing one's mind carries no emotional, functional, or systemic cost.
